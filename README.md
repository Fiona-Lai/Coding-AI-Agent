# Code Explanation AI Agent

A simple and functional React-based split-window application that connects with a Large Language Model (LLM) API (such as OpenAI's GPT) to explain code line by line and detect logical errors.

---

## Features

- **Split Interface**:  
  Left pane for code input, right pane for line-by-line explanation.

- **AI-Powered Code Analysis**:  
  Uses an LLM to:
  - Explain code logic.
  - Detect logical bugs and point out the lines causing them.

- **Flexible Language Support**:  
  Analyze code in multiple programming languages.

- **Expandable Features** (optional / creative additions):
  - Syntax highlighting
  - AI-generated suggestions
  - Code formatting
  - Inline comments generation

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or Python Flask/FastAPI)  
- **API**: OpenAI GPT API (or any LLM with code interpretation ability)
